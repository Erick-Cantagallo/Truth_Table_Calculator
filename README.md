# Truth Table Calculator ðŸ§®

This project was developed as part of a **Mathematical Logic** course.  
The goal is simple: given a logical expression, the program automatically generates its **truth table**, showing the logical values for all possible variable combinations.

The interface was built with **Tkinter (Python)** to keep everything minimal and user-friendly.

## Features
- Input of logical expressions (using operators like `Â¬`, `âˆ§`, `âˆ¨`, `â†’`, etc.)
- Automatic generation of the corresponding truth table
- Clean and easy-to-use graphical interface

## Technologies
- Python  
- Tkinter  
- itertools
  
---

## Purpose
To explore concepts of propositional logic in a practical way, combining programming and mathematics.
